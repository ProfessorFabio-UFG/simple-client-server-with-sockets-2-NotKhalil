# ClientServerBasics (2.0)
**This a simple implementation of a message encryption service based on a client-server architecture.**

The client must select the type of chyper and the text to be encrypted. The message is then sent to the server that encrypts the plaint text and returns the cypher text to the client.


The IP address and port of the server must be specified in the constCS.py file, respectively under HOST and PORT.
